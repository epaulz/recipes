serves: alot

ingredients:
- 1 lb extra sharp cheddar, shredded
- 0.5 lb monterey jack, shredded
- 16 oz elbow macaroni
- 1 cup sour cream
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 2 tbsp butter
- 1 cup mayo
- 2 tbsp flour
- 0.5 cup panko breadcrumbs
- 2 tbsp hot sauce
- 1 pack thin-sliced bacon (optional, see notes)

steps:
1.  cook macaroni al dente (see box).  drain and set aside.
2.  preheat smoker or oven to 350.
3.  melt butter in a large non-stick pot over medium heat.
4.  stir in flour 0.5 tbsp at a time, whisking each time until it thickens into a roux.
5.  when roux is ready, whisk in heavy cream 0.5 cup at a time until combined.
6.  sprinkle in cheese a handful at a time, stirring with a wooden spoon until melted and combined.
7.  stir in sour cream and mayo.
8.  stir in hot sauce and season with a little salt and pepper.
9.  when everything is melty and combined, stir in macaroni.
10. pour mixture into a greased skillet or casserole dish.
11. sprinkle panko breadcrumbs on top to form a crust.
12. place in smoker or oven and cook for 45-60 mins.

notes:
- you can cook a pack of bacon and then chop it up into fine pieces, then combined with the panko breadcrumbs.
- shredding a block of cheese by hand seems to produce better results than buying pre-shredded, but either will work.
